                <p>My name is Alyssa DiCarlo. I was born in a south suburb of Chicago 24 years ago. My snow hatin' family moved from Chicago, Illinois to sunny Phoenix, Arizona when I was five years old. It was in Arizona that I found the sport that I would come to love and appreciate for the rest of my life. I started playing softball in a recreational league at the age of six and ended my career as a professional softball player in the NPF (National Professional Fastpitch). In between, I had the opportunity to play for four years at the University of Georgia while earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics - some of the best years of my life. Now, my beautiful girlfriend, who also played softball in college, and I are attempting to find our way around this life without the sport we love. We currently live in another snowy, cold climate - Buffalo, NY. But I absolutely love it here, and I look forward to what's to come. </p>
